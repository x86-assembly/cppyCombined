# Combine python and c++

This is a program to combine python and c++ code into one file.

- Practical uses: None
- License: use/distribute/do anything but please don't use in production

## Usage:
1. Put your c++ code into a file named "cplusplus.cpp" (this code may not contain comments as I cold not be bothered to automatically remove them) also, every include/preproccesor macro must be put in a seperate file called cplusplusincludes.cpp
2. put your pythoncode into a file named "python.py"
3. run this script, and you will now find your combined code in a file named "your_final_program.cppy"

## How to contribute:

but if you want to anyway, please don't assume that i will check my github.
